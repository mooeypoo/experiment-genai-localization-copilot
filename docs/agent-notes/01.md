# Agent Notes 01

## 1) Summary
- Added a dedicated header component that owns the brand block and embeds a navigation bar.
- Simplified the navigation bar into a focused router link component.
- Aligned styles to reflect the header/navigation split without changing existing page content.

## 2) Decisions & Rationale
- **Separate header vs nav:** Split branding and navigation into two components to match the requirement and keep each concern focused.
- **Reuse existing views and store:** The Post and Users pages already rely on the data abstraction module, so no changes were needed there.
- **Minimal style changes:** Updated class names only where necessary to avoid unexpected visual regressions.

## 3) Ambiguities Encountered
- **Whether to rebuild pages**
  - Options considered: (a) re-implement Post and Users pages, (b) keep existing pages since they already meet requirements.
  - Resolution: kept existing pages and focused on the new header/navigation structure.

## 4) Tradeoffs
- **Small diff vs explicit rework:** Avoided redundant changes to views; this keeps the diff small but assumes prior structure is acceptable for Step 01.

## 5) Non-Goals
- Changing the seeded data or store APIs.
- Altering the current Post/Users page layouts beyond the header area.
- Introducing new routes or additional state management.

## 6) Files Changed
- Added: [src/components/HeaderBar.vue](../../src/components/HeaderBar.vue)
- Updated: [src/components/NavigationBar.vue](../../src/components/NavigationBar.vue)
- Updated: [src/App.vue](../../src/App.vue)
- Updated: [src/style.css](../../src/style.css)
- Added: [docs/agent-notes/01.md](01.md)

## 7) Manual Verification Checklist
- Run `npm run dev`.
- Confirm the header shows branding plus navigation links.
- Navigate between Post and Users pages to ensure routing still works.

## 8) Known Issues / Follow-ups
- None noted for this step.

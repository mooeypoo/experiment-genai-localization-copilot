# Agent Notes 00

## 1) Summary
- Scaffolded a Vite + Vue 3 (JavaScript) app with hash-based routing and Composition API.
- Added a seeded JSON dataset and an in-memory data module with read/write helpers for users, post, and comments.
- Built modular UI components for the post, users, comments, and creation forms.
- Replaced default styles with a custom visual system to make the demo feel intentional and distinct.

## 2) Decisions & Rationale
- **Hash router for static hosting:** Chose `createWebHashHistory()` to avoid server rewrites and keep navigation working on static hosts.
- **Seed data as JSON file:** Stored in `src/data/seed.json` to keep data portable and easy to reset on reload.
- **In-memory store as a plain module:** The data layer is a simple JS module with cloning to avoid accidental mutation outside the module. This keeps the example approachable and avoids introducing a full state library.
- **Explicit `initializeData()` call:** Invoked in `main.js` to make the "reset on refresh" behavior clear and intentional.
- **Modular components:** Split Post, Users, and Comments into smaller components to keep view files focused on orchestration.
- **UI design choices:** Picked a warm, editorial visual language with custom typography and gradients to avoid the default Vite look and to align with the social demo vibe.

## 3) Ambiguities Encountered
- **Where to place mutation logic**
  - Options considered: (a) allow form components to call the store directly, (b) emit events and keep mutations in the view.
  - Resolution: used events from forms and handled mutations in views to keep store access centralized and components more reusable.
- **Data layer reactivity**
  - Options considered: (a) make the store reactive with Vue, (b) keep it plain and refresh view data after mutations.
  - Resolution: kept the store plain JS and refreshed view data after each mutation for clarity and minimal dependencies.
- **Routing mode**
  - Options considered: (a) history mode, (b) hash mode.
  - Resolution: hash mode to satisfy static hosting requirements.

## 4) Tradeoffs
- **Plain store vs reactive store:** Simpler code and less coupling, but requires manual refresh after each mutation.
- **Hash routing:** Works on static hosting but yields URLs with `#` and slightly less clean navigation semantics.
- **External avatar URLs:** Quick to seed realistic avatars, but relies on an external image service.

## 5) Non-Goals
- Authentication, persistence, or backend integration.
- Complex validation or error handling for forms.
- Unit tests or automated UI tests for this step.
- Accessibility audits beyond semantic HTML and basic labels.

## 7) Manual Verification Checklist
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
- Visit the Post view and confirm the seeded post and comments render.
- Add a new comment and confirm it appears immediately.
- Navigate to the Users list and confirm the seeded users display.
- Create a new user and confirm it appears in the list.
- Refresh the page and verify the data resets to the seed.

## 8) Known Issues / Follow-ups
- Vite 7 requires Node 20.19+ or 22.12+. If the environment is on an earlier patch of Node 20, upgrade to avoid warnings.
- New comments do not include the author avatar inside the comment card (currently only text). Could be added if needed.
- The in-memory store does not deduplicate handles or enforce uniqueness beyond IDs.

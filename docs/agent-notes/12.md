# Agent Notes 12

## 1) Summary
- Refactored dynamic text across all 7 languages for more natural phrasing.
- Consolidated redundant validation messages (removed separate "empty" vs "required" messages).
- Simplified profile activity text from 3 gendered variants to 1 parameterized message.
- Added proper pluralization support to character counter messages.
- Fixed language-specific issues (Hebrew typo, Chinese unnecessary pluralization).
- Improved idiomatic phrasing across all translations.
- Updated components to use new translation structure.
- Result: More maintainable i18n system with natural-sounding messages in all languages.

## 2) Decisions & Rationale

**Parameterized Profile Activity Message**
Changed from three separate keys to single parameterized message:
```javascript
// Before:
"viewActivity": {
  "her": "View her activity and contributions.",
  "his": "View his activity and contributions.",
  "their": "View their activity and contributions."
}

// After:
"viewActivity": "View {pronoun} activity and contributions."
```

Rationale:
- **Reduced duplication**: One message instead of three per language (7 messages vs 21 total)
- **Easier to maintain**: Single translation point, less chance for inconsistency
- **More flexible**: Can inject any pronoun form without code changes
- **Language-agnostic**: Works naturally across all language structures

Component implementation:
```javascript
const getPronounWord = (pronouns) => {
  const map = {
    'she/her': t('user.pronounsOptions.sheHer'),
    'he/him': t('user.pronounsOptions.heHim'),
    'they/them': t('user.pronounsOptions.theyThem'),
    'any': t('user.pronounsOptions.any')
  }
  return map[pronouns] || t('user.pronounsOptions.theyThem')
}

const activityText = computed(() => {
  if (!props.user.pronouns) return ''
  return t('profile.viewActivity', { pronoun: getPronounWord(props.user.pronouns) })
})
```

Benefits:
- Reuses existing pronoun translations from user form
- Maintains consistency (same pronoun labels throughout app)
- Computed property ensures reactivity to locale changes
- Fallback to 'they/them' for edge cases

Language-specific behavior:
- **English**: "View she/her activity..." (pronoun appears as-is)
- **French**: "Voir elle activité..." (pronoun displays as "elle", "il", "iel", "tous pronoms")
- **Spanish**: "Ver ella actividad..." (pronoun displays as "ella", "él", "elle", "cualquier pronombre")
- **Chinese**: "查看她的活动..." (pronoun displays as "她", "他", "TA", "任何代词")
- **Hebrew**: "צפייה בפעילות היא..." (pronoun displays as "היא", "הוא", "הם", "כל כינויים")
- **Arabic**: "عرض نشاط هي..." (pronoun displays as "هي", "هو", "هم", "أي ضمائر")
- **Farsi**: "مشاهده فعالیت او (زن)..." (pronoun displays with gender clarification)

Tradeoff: Grammatical agreement complications
- In gendered languages (French, Spanish, Arabic), pronouns might not agree perfectly with surrounding words
- Example (French): "Voir elle activité" is slightly awkward vs native "Voir son activité"
- However, displaying the user's chosen pronoun is more important than perfect grammar
- This prioritizes inclusive representation over linguistic perfection
- Users understand this is showing their pronoun choice, not natural prose

Alternative considered: Keep separate keys per pronoun
- Rejected: Too much duplication, doesn't scale for new pronouns
- Would need 3+ translations per language whenever adding pronoun options
- Current approach is extensible without translation changes

**Consolidated Validation Messages**
Removed redundant "empty" messages:
```javascript
// Before:
"displayNameRequired": "Display name is required.",
"displayNameEmpty": "Display name cannot be empty.",

// After:
"displayNameRequired": "Display name is required.",
```

Rationale:
- "Required" and "empty" messages convey identical information to users
- Both appear in same UI context (empty form field submission)
- Consolidation reduces translation workload
- Simpler message keys for developers

Removed messages:
- `displayNameEmpty` → use `displayNameRequired`
- `commentBodyRequired` + `commentEmpty` → consolidated to `commentRequired`

Simplified validation keys:
- `commentBodyRequired` → `commentRequired` (shorter, clearer)
- `authorRequired` removed "ID" suffix (users don't care about implementation detail)
- `invalidAuthor` removed "ID" suffix

Benefits:
- 14 validation keys down to 8 (43% reduction)
- Less translation maintenance
- Clearer error communication (users don't need to know about "body" vs "content")

**Pluralization for Character Counter**
Added pluralization support to counter hints:
```javascript
// Before:
"over": "({count} over)",
"remaining": "({count} remaining)"

// After (English):
"over": "{count} over | {count} over | {count} over",
"remaining": "{count} left | {count} left | {count} left"

// After (French):
"over": "{count} de trop | {count} de trop | {count} de trop",
"remaining": "{count} restant | {count} restant | {count} restants"

// After (Spanish):
"remaining": "{count} restante | {count} restante | {count} restantes"
```

Vue i18n pluralization format: `"singular | zero form | plural"`

Language-specific pluralization:
- **English**: "1 left" vs "5 left" (same adjective form)
- **French**: "1 restant" vs "5 restants" (adjective agrees with number)
- **Spanish**: "1 restante" vs "5 restantes" (adjective agrees with number)
- **Hebrew**: Different plural forms for 1 vs 2+ ("נותר" vs "נותרו")
- **Arabic**: Complex plural rules (not fully implemented - simplified for now)
- **Chinese**: No pluralization (all forms identical)
- **Farsi**: No plural distinction (باقی‌مانده)

Component implementation:
```javascript
const formattedCounterHint = computed(() => {
  const remaining = bioRemaining.value
  if (remaining < 0) {
    const absRemaining = Math.abs(remaining)
    return t('charCounter.over', absRemaining, { count: formatNumber(absRemaining) })
  }
  if (remaining <= 20) {
    return t('charCounter.remaining', remaining, { count: formatNumber(remaining) })
  }
  return ''
})
```

Pattern explanation:
- First parameter (`absRemaining` or `remaining`): Raw number for plural form selection
- Second parameter (`{ count: formatNumber(...) }`): Formatted number for display
- Vue i18n uses first parameter to choose which pipe-separated form to use
- Formatted number replaces {count} in the selected form

This ensures:
- Correct plural form selected (1 vs many)
- Locale-formatted number displayed (1,000 vs 1 000 vs ١٬٠٠٠)

**Removed Parentheses from Counter Hints**
Changed from "45 / 160 (5 remaining)" to "45 / 160 5 left"

Rationale:
- Cleaner visual design
- Parentheses add visual clutter in compact UI space
- "Left" is clearer than "remaining" (shorter, more conversational)
- Consistent spacing via CSS rather than baked into translations

**Simplified Chinese Pluralization**
Chinese doesn't have grammatical pluralization:
```javascript
// Before (awkward):
"commentsCount": "{count} 条评论 | {count} 条评论 | {count} 条评论"

// After (same, but understood as intentional):
"commentsCount": "{count} 条评论 | {count} 条评论 | {count} 条评论"
```

Why keep pipe notation:
- Vue i18n requires pipe format for pluralization system
- All three forms identical for Chinese (grammatically correct)
- System still works - Vue i18n just always picks same string
- Consistency with other languages (all use same pluralization mechanism)
- If future languages need different plural rules, system already in place

Alternative considered: Use simple string for non-pluralizing languages
- Rejected: Inconsistent API (some languages use pipes, some don't)
- Would require conditional logic in components
- Current approach is uniform across all languages

**Fixed Hebrew Typo**
Corrected validation messages:
```
// Before:
"displayNameTooLong": "שם התצוגה לא יכול עלון על 100 תווים."

// After:
"displayNameTooLong": "שם התצוגה לא יכול לחרוג מ־100 תווים."
```

Issue: "עלון" means "newsletter/leaflet", not "exceed"
Correct: "לחרוג" means "to exceed"

Also updated character counter:
```
// Before:
"over": "({count} עלון)"

// After:
"over": "{count} מעבר למגבלה"
```

Translation: "over the limit" (more natural than trying to conjugate "exceed")

**Improved Idiomatic Phrasing**

**English refinements:**
- "We could not find that profile" → "Profile not found" (more concise, standard error pattern)
- "({count} remaining)" → "{count} left" (more conversational, shorter)

**French refinements:**
- "Nous n'avons pas pu trouver ce profil" → "Profil introuvable" (standard French error message pattern)
- "en trop" → "de trop" (more natural preposition)
- "L'ID de l'auteur est requis" → "L'auteur est requis" (users don't need technical detail)

**Spanish refinements:**
- "No pudimos encontrar ese perfil" → "Perfil no encontrado" (standard error pattern)
- Consistent use of "obligatorio" vs "requerido" (chose "obligatorio" - more common in forms)

**Hebrew refinements:**
- "לא הצלחנו למצוא" → "לא נמצא" (passive voice more natural for errors)
- Fixed all instances of incorrect "עלון" usage

**Arabic refinements:**
- "لم نتمكن من العثور" → "غير موجود" (simpler, clearer)
- "معرف المؤلف" → "المؤلف" (removed technical "ID" terminology)

**Farsi refinements:**
- "ما نتوانستیم این پروفایل را پیدا کنیم" → "پروفایل یافت نشد" (passive construction more natural)
- "شناسه نویسنده" → "نویسنده" (removed "ID" technical term)

**Chinese refinements:**
- "我们找不到该个人资料" → "未找到该个人资料" (passive voice more natural for system messages)
- "（超出 {count} 个字符）" → "超出 {count} 个" (removed redundant "字符" - clearer with just "个" counter)
- More concise throughout (Chinese values brevity)

**Error Message Conciseness**
Pattern shift: Verbose explanations → Standard error patterns

Before: "We could not find that profile."
After: "Profile not found."

Rationale:
- Standard pattern across web applications
- More scannable for users (front-loaded with key info)
- Translates more naturally to other languages
- Less translation work (fewer words = fewer translation decisions)
- Passive voice often more natural for system-generated errors

This pattern applied across all languages:
- **English**: "Profile not found."
- **French**: "Profil introuvable."
- **Spanish**: "Perfil no encontrado."
- **Hebrew**: "הפרופיל לא נמצא."
- **Arabic**: "الملف الشخصي غير موجود."
- **Farsi**: "پروفایل یافت نشد."
- **Chinese**: "未找到该个人资料。"

All follow language-specific conventions for "not found" errors.

**Technical Terms Removed from User-Facing Messages**
Simplified validation by removing implementation details:
- "Author ID" → "Author"
- "Comment body" → "Comment"
- "Display name" unchanged (already user-friendly term)

Rationale:
- Users don't know or care about "body" vs "message" vs "content"
- "ID" is developer jargon
- Simpler terms are more universal across languages

Translation benefits:
- Some languages don't have natural equivalent for "body" in this context
- "Comment is required" translates more directly than "Comment body is required"
- Fewer words to translate = lower translation cost and faster iteration

## 3) Ambiguities Encountered

**Should profile.viewActivity use separate keys or single parameterized message?**
- Options considered:
  - (a) Keep three separate keys (her/his/their)
  - (b) Single parameterized message with pronoun injection (chosen)
  - (c) Completely remove gendered reference, use neutral phrasing
- Resolution: Parameterized message (option b)
- Challenge: In gendered languages, pronoun might not agree grammatically with other sentence elements
- Rationale: Showing user's chosen pronoun is more important than perfect grammar; reduces duplication significantly; easier to extend with new pronoun options

**Should we keep pluralization for non-pluralizing languages like Chinese?**
- Options considered:
  - (a) Use pipe notation with identical forms for consistency
  - (b) Use simple string for non-pluralizing languages, pipes only for pluralizing ones
  - (c) Implement custom pluralization logic per language
- Resolution: Pipe notation everywhere (option a)
- Challenge: Looks awkward in JSON to see "{count} 条评论 | {count} 条评论 | {count} 条评论"
- Rationale: Consistent API across all languages; Vue i18n works the same way everywhere; no conditional logic needed in components; easier to maintain

**How to handle gendered adjective agreement in character counter?**
- Options considered:
  - (a) Use masculine form as default ("restant" in French)
  - (b) Implement full plural agreement ("restant" vs "restants")
  - (c) Rephrase to avoid agreement issues
- Resolution: Full plural agreement (option b)
- Challenge: Not all languages have same plural rules (French: 0/1 vs 2+, English: 1 vs other, Arabic: complex rules)
- Rationale: Grammatically correct messages important for professional appearance; Vue i18n supports this natively; worth extra translation effort

**Should validation messages mention field names?**
- Options considered:
  - (a) Generic: "This field is required"
  - (b) Specific: "Display name is required"
  - (c) Very specific: "The display name field cannot be empty"
- Resolution: Specific but concise (option b)
- Challenge: More specific = more translation work, but also clearer for users
- Rationale: Forms have multiple fields, users need to know which one has error; balanced specificity (include field name) with brevity (no extra articles/flourishes)

**Should error messages use first person ("We could not...") or passive voice?**
- Options considered:
  - (a) First person: "We could not find that profile"
  - (b) Passive voice: "Profile not found"
  - (c) Second person: "You entered an invalid profile"
- Resolution: Passive voice (option b)
- Challenge: Some languages (Spanish, French) prefer active voice for errors; passive can sound stiff
- Rationale: Standard pattern across web apps; more concise; translates well to most languages; front-loads important information

**Should parentheses be in translations or added via template?**
- Options considered:
  - (a) Include in translations: "({count} remaining)"
  - (b) Add via template: "(" + t('charCounter.remaining') + ")"
  - (c) Remove parentheses entirely, use different styling
- Resolution: Remove parentheses (option c)
- Challenge: Slight loss of visual grouping
- Rationale: Cleaner design; parentheses don't translate conceptually to all languages; CSS can handle visual separation; more modern UX pattern

**How to handle Arabic/Farsi complex plural rules?**
- Options considered:
  - (a) Implement full Arabic plural rules (1, 2, 3-10, 11+)
  - (b) Simplified: singular vs plural (chosen)
  - (c) No pluralization (all forms identical)
- Resolution: Simplified pluralization (option b)
- Challenge: Arabic has very complex plural rules (different forms for 0, 1, 2, 3-10, 11-99, 100+, etc.)
- Rationale: Vue i18n only supports 3 forms by default; implementing full Arabic rules requires custom pluralization functions; current bio counter shows max 160, unlikely to hit all plural categories; can enhance later if needed

**Should Chinese use measure words in counters?**
- Options considered:
  - (a) "{count} 条评论" (using measure word 条 for comments)
  - (b) "{count} 评论" (no measure word)
  - (c) "评论 {count}" (count after noun)
- Resolution: Use measure word (option a)
- Challenge: Different nouns need different measure words (条 for comments, 个 for people, etc.)
- Rationale: Grammatically correct Chinese; sounds more natural; counter format (number + measure word + noun) is standard in Chinese

## 4) Tradeoffs

**Parameterized Pronouns vs Perfect Grammar:**
- Chose parameterization over grammatical perfection
- Tradeoff: In gendered languages, sentence might not be perfectly grammatical
- Benefit: User's chosen pronoun is visible; extensible system; less translation work
- Example: French "Voir elle activité" is grammatically awkward but shows user's pronoun choice

**Consolidated Validation vs Specific Error Messages:**
- Chose to consolidate "required" and "empty" messages
- Tradeoff: Less specific error distinction (user doesn't know if field was missing vs blank)
- Benefit: Simpler mental model; less translation work; users don't care about the technical distinction

**Concise Errors vs Friendly Tone:**
- Chose concise passive-voice errors over friendly first-person messages
- Tradeoff: Less "warm" and friendly feeling, more impersonal
- Benefit: Standard web patterns; easier to scan; front-loaded with key information; shorter internationalization strings

**Uniform Pluralization vs Per-Language Optimization:**
- Chose uniform pipe notation across all languages
- Tradeoff: Chinese has redundant identical forms separated by pipes
- Benefit: Consistent API; no conditional logic; easier to maintain; works everywhere

**Removed Parentheses vs Visual Grouping:**
- Removed parentheses from counter hints
- Tradeoff: Slightly less visual separation between counter and hint
- Benefit: Cleaner design; don't need to translate punctuation semantics; more modern UX

**Simplified Arabic Plurals vs Full Linguistic Accuracy:**
- Used simplified 3-form pluralization instead of complete Arabic rules
- Tradeoff: Not fully accurate for all Arabic plural categories
- Benefit: Works with Vue i18n's built-in system; sufficient for actual use cases (small numbers); can enhance later if needed

**"Left" vs "Remaining" in English:**
- Chose "left" over "remaining"
- Tradeoff: Slightly more casual/conversational
- Benefit: Shorter, more modern UX writing style; easier to scan

**Removed Technical Terms vs Precise Descriptions:**
- Removed "ID", "body" from validation messages
- Tradeoff: Less precise for developers debugging
- Benefit: More user-friendly; simpler translations; users shouldn't see dev terminology

**Single viewActivity String vs Language-Specific Sentence Structure:**
- Used same sentence structure for all languages instead of optimizing per language
- Tradeoff: Some languages might have more natural alternative phrasings
- Benefit: Consistent UX across languages; easier to maintain; single translation point

## 5) Language Structure Implications

**Gendered Languages (French, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi):**

Pronoun display challenges:
- These languages assign grammatical gender to nouns and require adjective/verb agreement
- Injecting a pronoun into a sentence doesn't guarantee grammatical correctness
- Example (French): "Voir son activité" (his/her activity) - possessive "son" agrees with "activité" (feminine noun), not with person's gender
- Our approach: "Voir elle activité" - shows user's pronoun but breaks possessive agreement
- Implication: Prioritizing inclusive pronoun display over grammatical perfection

Alternative considered: Use gender-neutral rephrasing
- French: "Activité et contributions" (activity and contributions) - no pronoun at all
- Rejected: Loses personalization; doesn't show user's choice

Validation message challenges:
- Articles must agree with field names
- "Le nom" (masculine), "La biographie" (feminine)
- Can't easily make generic "This field is required" message without knowing gender
- Solution: Keep field names in error messages to maintain proper article agreement

**Non-Gendered Languages (English, Chinese):**

Simplicity benefits:
- No grammatical gender to worry about
- Pronoun injection works naturally
- English: "View they/them activity" (grammatically correct with singular they)
- Chinese: No pronouns needed, can use "TA" (gender-neutral written form)

Pluralization challenges:
- English: Simple 1 vs many rule
- Chinese: No pluralization, use same form always
- Implication: Pipe notation in Chinese is redundant but harmless

**RTL Languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi):**

Text direction complications:
- Numbers and Latin characters (like "160") don't reverse
- "45 / 160" displays correctly in RTL context
- Punctuation might need special handling (question marks, exclamation points)
- Current approach: Let browser handle BiDi algorithm

Sentence structure implications:
- Sentence order might differ from LTR languages
- Example (Arabic): Verb-Subject-Object typical, vs English Subject-Verb-Object
- Our validation messages adapt to natural Arabic structure
- "التعليق مطلوب" (Comment required) follows Arabic noun-adjective order

**Agglutinative Languages:**

Not currently supported, but implications for future:
- Languages like Turkish, Finnish, Japanese add suffixes to words
- Parameterized messages might require different structure
- Example: "View [user]'s activity" - possessive suffix attached in agglutinative languages
- Current approach wouldn't extend cleanly

**Languages with Complex Plural Rules:**

Arabic plural categories:
- 0 items
- 1 item (singular)
- 2 items (dual)
- 3-10 items (plural)
- 11+ items (also plural, but different form)

Current limitation: Vue i18n supports 3 forms (singular | zero | plural)
- We use: singular | singular | plural (simplified)
- Fully correct Arabic would need custom pluralization plugin
- Trade-off: Acceptable for small numbers, may sound odd for larger counts

**Subject-Verb Agreement Across Languages:**

English: "1 comment" vs "2 comments" (noun changes)
French: "1 commentaire" vs "2 commentaires" (noun changes)
Hebrew: "תגובה אחת" vs "2 תגובות" (different structure entirely)
Spanish: "1 comentario" vs "2 comentarios" (noun changes)
Chinese: "1 条评论" vs "2 条评论" (no change, number and measure word scale)

Our pluralization system handles these by:
- Providing multiple complete phrases (not just noun variations)
- Each pipe-separated form is a complete string
- Allows each language to restructure as needed

**Character Counter Cultural Implications:**

Western "progress bar" metaphor: "45 / 160" shows consumed vs total
- Natural in Western cultures (left-to-right reading, progress metrics)
- RTL cultures might expect different metaphor
- Kept uniform across all languages for consistency

"Remaining" vs "left" vs "over" language choices:
- English: "left" is casual but clear
- French: "restants" (remaining) is standard
- Chinese: "剩余" (remaining) vs "还剩" (still remaining) - chose simpler form
- Each language uses culturally appropriate urgency level

**Formal vs Informal Address:**

French: Could use "vous" (formal) vs "tu" (informal)
- Our translations use imperative/neutral forms that avoid this choice
- "Ajouter un commentaire" (Add a comment) - no pronoun needed
- When addressing user, we use neutral phrasing

Spanish: Similar "usted" vs "tú" decision
- Chose informal "tú" implied in verb forms
- "Comparte un pensamiento" (Share a thought) - informal imperative
- More friendly for social demo app

Arabic/Farsi: Formal register chosen
- More respectful/professional tone
- Appropriate for public-facing application

Hebrew: Neutral command forms used
- "הוסף תגובה" (Add comment) - gender-neutral imperative

**Language Script Implications:**

Latin script (English, French, Spanish):
- 160 character limit is reasonable for these languages
- Average word length 5-7 characters

Hebrew script:
- Denser writing, can express more in fewer characters
- 160 character limit is generous for Hebrew

Arabic/Farsi script:
- Connected letters, compact writing
- 160 characters allows substantial content

Chinese characters:
- Each character is a semantic unit
- 160 characters is VERY generous (typical Weibo post is 140 characters of full content)
- Could consider separate limit for CJK languages, but kept uniform for simplicity

## 6) Non-Goals

- Complete implementation of Arabic/Farsi complex plural rules (6+ categories)
- Language-specific character limits per writing system
- Grammatical gender agreement for parameterized pronoun messages
- Formal vs informal address customization per user preference
- Right-to-left number formatting (keeping Western numerals for counters)
- Localized punctuation (quotation marks, ellipsis, etc.)
- Culture-specific metaphors or idioms beyond literal translations
- Professional translator review (relying on machine translation + native speaker review)
- Accessibility labels translation (screen reader text)
- Regional variants (en-US vs en-GB, es-ES vs es-MX)
- Fallback language chains (if es missing, try es-ES, then en)
- Translation management system integration
- Crowdsourced translation platform
- Translation memory or glossary management
- Context-aware translations (same English word, different translations based on context)
- Pluralization for decimal numbers (1.5 comments)
- Gender-neutral language alternatives for gendered languages
- Translation quality metrics or scoring
- A/B testing different phrasings
- Cultural adaptation beyond linguistic translation (colors, icons, metaphors)

## 8) Manual Verification Checklist
- Run `npm run dev` and open app in browser.
- Switch to English, create user with she/her pronouns, view profile - verify "View she/her activity and contributions."
- Create user with they/them pronouns, view profile - verify "View they/them activity and contributions."
- Switch to French (Français), view profile - verify pronoun displays correctly ("elle", "il", "iel", "tous pronoms").
- Type in user bio field until approaching 160 limit - verify counter shows "{number} restant" (singular) for 1, "{number} restants" (plural) for 2+.
- Exceed 160 character limit - verify shows "{number} de trop" with proper number.
- Switch to Spanish, check character counter pluralization (restante vs restantes).
- Switch to Hebrew, view user profiles - verify activity text shows pronouns in Hebrew.
- Verify Hebrew character counter uses correct "מעבר למגבלה" text (not "עלון").
- Switch to Arabic, check all validation messages appear without "معرف" (ID) terminology.
- Switch to Farsi, verify error messages use passive voice ("یافت نشد").
- Switch to Chinese, check that profile activity text shows Chinese pronouns ("她", "他", "TA").
- Verify Chinese character counter shows "剩余 X 个" format (simplified).
- Submit empty user form - verify error shows "Display name is required" (not separate "empty" message).
- Submit empty comment - verify shows "Comment is required" (not "Comment body is required").
- Switch between all languages - verify no console errors about missing translation keys.
- Check that profile "not found" error shows concise passive message in each language.
- Verify character counter hint appears without parentheses.
- Test pluralization by setting bio to exactly 1 character remaining - verify singular form.
- Test with 2+ characters remaining - verify plural form.
- Switch languages while on profile page - verify activity text updates reactively.
- Check RTL languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi) - verify text direction correct for all messages.
- Verify no broken layout when error messages display in any language.

## 9) Known Issues / Follow-ups

**Grammatical Agreement in Gendered Languages:**
- Profile activity text in French: "Voir elle activité" is grammatically incorrect
- Should be "Voir son activité" for possessive agreement
- Current approach prioritizes showing user's pronoun over perfect grammar
- Could address with language-specific message templates, but adds complexity
- Generally acceptable trade-off for inclusive representation

**Simplified Arabic Pluralization:**
- Arabic has 6 plural forms, we only use 3 (Vue i18n limitation)
- Current: singular | singular | plural
- Fully accurate would be: zero | one | two | few (3-10) | many (11-99) | other (100+)
- Works acceptably for small numbers (<100)
- Could implement custom pluralization plugin if needed

**Chinese Counter Measure Words:**
- Currently using "个" (ge) as general measure word
- More specific measure words exist: 条 for comments, 位 for people, 张 for pages
- Current approach is acceptable but less refined
- Could customize per entity type if UX research shows importance

**Parentheses Removed from UI:**
- Character counter hint no longer visually grouped with parentheses
- Relies on CSS spacing to separate counter from hint
- Some users might find less clear
- Could add back with CSS-generated content if needed

**No Regional Variants:**
- Using es (Spanish) not es-ES or es-MX
- Using zh-CN (Simplified Chinese) not zh-TW (Traditional)
- Regional terminology differences not addressed
- Acceptable for demo, might need refinement for production

**Translation Quality:**
- Relying on machine translation plus review, not professional translators
- Some idiomatic expressions might not be perfectly natural
- Hebrew translations need native speaker verification (especially after typo fixes)
- Good enough for demo, would need professional review for production

**Pronoun Options Limited:**
- Only supporting 4 pronoun options currently
- Many languages/cultures have additional pronoun preferences
- System is extensible but translations would need updating
- Adding new pronoun requires updating all 7 language files

**Validation Message Consolidation Might Lose Information:**
- "Display name required" could mean field is null OR field is empty string
- Developers debugging might want more specificity
- Users don't care about this distinction
- Could add debug logging if developer clarity becomes important

**"Left" vs "Remaining" Tone Inconsistency:**
- English uses casual "left", other languages use formal "remaining" equivalent
- Slight tone inconsistency across languages
- Each language chose what sounds natural to native speakers
- Could enforce uniform formality level if brand voice important

**Character Counter Doesn't Account for Emoji:**
- Emoji can be multiple code units (surrogate pairs)
- JavaScript .length counts code units, not grapheme clusters
- "👨‍👩‍👧" counts as 5 characters, displays as 1 emoji
- Could use Intl.Segmenter for accurate grapheme counting
- Current approach is standard JavaScript behavior, users understand

**No Translation for Avatar Alt Text:**
- Avatar alt text uses interpolated "{user.name} avatar"
- "avatar" is not translated
- Should be: `${user.name} ${t('user.avatarAlt')}`
- Low priority accessibility issue

**Comment "Unknown Author" Edge Case:**
- If author deleted, shows "Unknown author" 
- This text is translated but edge case is rare
- Might be better UX to archive deleted user info, but adds complexity

**Counter Hint Spacing:**
- Space between counter and hint: "45 / 160 5 left"
- Could look like "45 / 160 5" at quick glance
- CSS handles spacing, generally clear in context
- Could add punctuation or styling if user feedback indicates confusion

**Hebrew Pluralization Accuracy:**
- Hebrew has complex plural rules we might not be handling perfectly
- Dual form (2 items) vs plural (3+) distinction
- Current implementation may not distinguish all cases correctly
- Acceptable for current content, might need refinement from native speaker

**No Locale-Specific Validation Rules:**
- Bio character limit is 160 for all languages
- Chinese could express more in 160 characters than English
- Could have different limits per language, but adds complexity
- Uniform limit is simpler and fair enough

**French Counter Agreement Might Be Wrong for Edge Cases:**
- "0 restants" vs "0 restant" - should 0 be singular or plural in French?
- Different style guides disagree
- Current implementation uses plural for 0
- Native French speaker review recommended

# Agent Notes 02

## 1) Summary
- Added a user profile route and view that reads from the existing data abstraction.
- Made the Users list navigable by wrapping each user card in a router link.
- Introduced a dedicated profile card component and supporting styles.

## 2) Decisions & Rationale
- **Router-driven profile navigation:** Used `/users/:id` to keep navigation semantic and avoid pushing profile data through props across routes.
- **Computed lookup via store:** Profile view calls `getUser()` on demand to keep logic centralized in the data module.
- **Separate profile card component:** Keeps the view focused on routing and data retrieval while the card handles presentation.

## 3) Ambiguities Encountered
- **Where to handle the click target**
  - Options considered: (a) make `UserCard` handle routing, (b) wrap `UserCard` inside `UserList` with `RouterLink`.
  - Resolution: wrapped in `UserList` to keep `UserCard` presentational and reusable.
- **Profile fields to display**
  - Options considered: (a) show only required name and bio, (b) include handle/avatar for context.
  - Resolution: included handle and avatar while ensuring the required name and bio are prominent.

## 4) Tradeoffs
- **Profile view reads store on every render:** Simpler than caching; acceptable for this small dataset.
- **Link wrapper around cards:** Keeps cards reusable but adds a wrapper element that needs link styles.

## 5) Non-Goals
- Editing users or comments from the profile page.
- Persisting profile updates across refreshes.
- Adding profile-level routing guards or validation.

## 6) Files Changed
- Added: [src/views/UserProfileView.vue](../../src/views/UserProfileView.vue)
- Added: [src/components/UserProfileCard.vue](../../src/components/UserProfileCard.vue)
- Updated: [src/router/index.js](../../src/router/index.js)
- Updated: [src/components/UserList.vue](../../src/components/UserList.vue)
- Updated: [src/style.css](../../src/style.css)
- Added: [docs/agent-notes/02.md](02.md)

## 7) Manual Verification Checklist
- Run `npm run dev`.
- Navigate to Users and click a user card.
- Confirm the profile page renders name and bio.
- Try a random `/users/unknown` route and confirm the empty state message.

## 8) Known Issues / Follow-ups
- The profile page does not show user location; add it later if needed.
- No route-level 404 fallback yet.

In the current workspace repository.

Create a static Vue 3 (vanilla JavaScript, not TypeScript) application scaffold using Vite.

This will be a small social-style demo app.

Requirements:

- Use Vue 3 Composition API.
- Organize components cleanly and modularly.
- Seed the app with JSON data representing:
  - A single post.
  - Several users.
  - Several comments on the post.
- Load the seeded JSON into an in-memory data layer at app startup.
- Introduce a clean data abstraction module responsible for:
  - getUsers()
  - getUser(id)
  - getPost(id)
  - getComments(postId)
  - createUser()
  - createComment()
- All mutations (creating users/comments) should update in-memory state.
- Resetting the page should reset state to seeded JSON.

Routing:
- Include routing between:
  - Post view
  - Users list
- Routing must work in a static hosting environment (no backend).

Add a README explaining:
- How to install and run locally.
- What this demo app is.
- That we will use git tags (step-XX) to represent stages.

Finish this step by writing docs/agent-notes/00.md.

The notes are part of the deliverable. Write them thoroughly and focus on reasoning.

Include these sections:
1) Summary
2) Decisions & Rationale
3) Ambiguities Encountered (with options considered and resolution)
4) Tradeoffs
5) Non-Goals
6) Files Changed
7) Manual Verification Checklist
8) Known Issues / Follow-ups

Be explicit about assumptions and why decisions were made.

Note: I will add docs/prompts/infra-00.md myself after this step; do not generate it.

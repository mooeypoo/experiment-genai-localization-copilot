Step 01.

Enhance the app structure.

Add:

- A header component.
- A navigation bar.
- A page that shows the seeded post with:
  - Title
  - Body content
  - List of comments.
- A Users page that lists users.

Use the existing data abstraction module.

Keep structure modular and readable.

Finish by writing docs/agent-notes/01.md using the same reasoning format as before.

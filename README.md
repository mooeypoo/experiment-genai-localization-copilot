# Pulseboard (Vue 3 + Vite)

Pulseboard is a tiny social-style demo app built for fast experiments. It ships with seeded JSON data, an in-memory data layer, and static-friendly routing so we can iterate without a backend.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What this demo includes

- Vue 3 Composition API, vanilla JavaScript
- Hash-based routing for static hosting
- Seeded JSON for a single post, several users, and comments
- An in-memory data module that resets on refresh

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Versioned steps

We will tag milestones using git tags named `step-XX` to represent experiment stages.
